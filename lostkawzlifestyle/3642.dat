705	<p>When summer begins to wind down for most, on the illustrious island of Ibiza the scene is quite the opposite. With summers lasting longer and longer, tourists still make their way to paradise at the end of September to be immersed by the most well balanced lineup of drum and bass artists at any festival this summer. After our first swing at Sunbeatz Ibiza a few years ago, we were eager to check back in for a week of all styles and sub-genres of dnb on one of our favorite island destinations. The weeklong event featured pool parties, sunset boat parties, and an impressive showcase of some of Ibiza’s most famous clubs<br>\n<br>\n<cms-plugin title="Image - 12002312_10153812647489349_1228657076199034787_n.jpg" alt="Image - 12002312_10153812647489349_1228657076199034787_n.jpg " id="707"></cms-plugin></p>\n\n<p><br>\nSunbeatz attendees were greeted every day at the Kayna beach bar, where hosts checked in partiers and attendees met to chill and hang by the pool or grab a cocktail at the bar.  Within walking distance from most of the hotels, it was the perfect opportunity to get acquainted with the town of San Antonio, which played host to the week’s crazy activities. Make no mistake, the Ibiza nightlife is as insane as you would expect, even with summer winding to a close. The streets are lined with bars and cafes that carter to the thousands of people on holiday. San Antonio is alive till the early morning hours with a plethora of trouble to be found.</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p>Club Eden hosted Hazard’s “Heroes” night; a collection of artists personally picked by Hazard who rolled through rowdy, jungle sounds from a collective of legends in the industry. The night featured Hazard, Hype, Micky Finn, Randall, Brockie, and selected the finest of their respected sub-genres along with a dubs and unreleased bits off labels like Playaz. The system was clear and kept the crowd alive with baseline pressure until 6:00 am. It was a proper salute to jungle without a doubt.</p>\n\n<p><cms-plugin title="Image - 12088227_1109046982440361_7924245820193916137_n.jpg" alt="Image - 12088227_1109046982440361_7924245820193916137_n.jpg " id="831"></cms-plugin></p>\n\n<p>On a short death-defying bus ride from San Antonio, we ventured out to the popular club Privilege. Generally, this club plays host to some of the biggest names in dance music such as Tiesto, Carl Cox, etc. The only thing that mattered on Thursday night was Planet V. With label boss Brian G in the building, the sound selection for the night might have been the best of the weekend. Bringing the liquid jungle vibes, Brian Gee, Dillinja, S.P.Y., Jumpin Jack Frost, Ruffstuff, and Harry Bizzle; with hosts for the evening Dynamite, Ic3, Funsta, Darrison, and Mekar kept the crowd moving.</p>\n\n<p>Other notable nights included a One Nation and Breaking Science night with Mampi Swift and Sub Zero- whose four deck selections were nothing short of impeccable. It’s no wonder Sub Zero has become somewhat of a regular on the California scene, making regular appearances in LA. In addition to DJ Inter Friller b2b Boylan, DJ Guv and DJ Sly, both huge producers currently making waves for their new take on jump-up, rolled through countless wonky tunes, which at times were hard differentiate between live remixes and VIPs. Standard for most Sunbeatz festivals, Ram Records hosted the biggest night in the main area of the super club Privilege. With one part of the dance floor suspended over water, the three-hour one-man Andy C show had the ravers struggle to keep up at the end of night.<br>\n </p>\n\n<p><cms-plugin title="Image - 12105734_1112266488785077_9106782864984381474_n.jpg" alt="Image - 12105734_1112266488785077_9106782864984381474_n.jpg " id="708"></cms-plugin></p>\n\n<p><br>\nRounding out the weekend and into Monday was the truly unique party at the old Ibiza zoo, which has been turned into an event venue that tailors to more traditional forms of EDM. The junglists took it over to party in the seal pit, in the pools and throughout the zoo. Jumping off early in the day, the after parties popped off until daybreak with Lowdown b2b Sumo running selections throughout the night.</p>\n\n<p>The sunset boat parties under clear skies with nocking systems and stiff drinks kept ravers skanking and sloshing across the dance floor. The Sunbeatz week came to a close with a water party at club Es Paradis, where Awol and Jungle Mania featured past, present and future of jungle and drum and bass.</p>\n\n<p><cms-plugin title="Image - 12111999_1108168749194851_4602741070232471409_n.jpg" alt="Image - 12111999_1108168749194851_4602741070232471409_n.jpg " id="709"></cms-plugin></p>\n\n<p><br>\nPeople travel around the world for many reason, but they usually end up in Ibiza for the parties. Sunbeatz continues to bring a different approach to the game, and is truly for the high-stamina crowd. A week long of partying is a lot for anyone, let alone the lack of sleep, hangovers, and sun burns. The Sunbeatz following goes hard day in and day out, packing the clubs and raging till the sun rises. The festival stands alone in bringing a perfect mixture of top-notch clubs with quality sound, in addition to efficient organization of week’s events. The only downside was a serious lack of stateside representation both in artists and attendees, but we firmly believe that Sunbeatz has an opportunity for growth, and will soon attract a more international crowd. We look forward to being back to the party island again soon!</p>

222	<p>In a surreal setting alongside a pristine river outside the city of Vancouver, Canada is a festival that in the past seven years has grown from a tight gathering of friends in Squamish, BC to a “immersive multimedia environment”. This summer, the landscape comes to life July 10-13 for what is sure to be another transformational experience. The organizers consistently strive to book world renowned DJs, musicians, and producers from across the globe to promote the absolute best in underground sound. Although festival has gained international status, since their inception they continue to preserve the seamless and inspiring vibes that are known as <a href="http://basscoast.ca/">Bass Coast</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Year after year, the festival showcases all styles of forward-thinking music, and this year’s line up is stacked with some of the most innovative and cutting edge producers in drum and bass, dubstep and bass music. Some of this years stand out names include OmUnit, J. Kenzo Sinistarr, EPROM, Sam Binga, Diamond Saints, and Justin Martin in addition to a well-rounded spectrum of local talent. With the festival just weeks away, tickets are still available for what is sure to be another wicked time with progressive individuals. Bass Coasts’ crew of builders and volunteers are already on site incorporating over 50 art and visual installations throughout the festival grounds. This years massive PK sound systems and attention to detail from the entire crew is sure to leave some festival goers searching for their marbles come Monday.<cms-plugin title="Image - Bass-Coast-main-stage1-e1435691484184.jpg" alt="Image - Bass-Coast-main-stage1-e1435691484184.jpg " id="223"></cms-plugin></p>\n\n<p>For more info and up to date news check into the <a href="http://basscoast.ca/">Bass Coast website</a> or <a href="https://www.facebook.com/BassCoastFestival?fref=ts">Facebook</a> for links tickets and all other important details.</p>
231	<p>We caught up with the newly redesigned <a href="http://thensubordinate.com/">Nsub</a> (formerly <a href="https://www.facebook.com/NSUBORDINATE">The Nsubordinate</a>) to see what the new project is all about. From its inception, the team has been committed to documenting the streets and counter-culture from around the world. Now with a new stye and new direction, they will be showcasing this years projects in a print format to display what subculture is all about. Encompassing graffiti, street photography, art, music, festival and underground culture; it will be interesting to see the impact the new magazine has on a new and ever-changing street and underground culture.</p>\n\n<h4>Give us a little history about the magazine and why it was founded. What were the original goals for the project?</h4>\n\n<p>The Insubordinate was established in 2007 as a project that I did in my spare time at SDSU and I wanted to include some of the interest of my friends. It was always intended to be a Zine that documented street culture- mostly graffiti- with some decent color photographs.</p>\n\n<h4>What will you be doing to showcase the new magazine launch?</h4>\n\n<p>The new launch is about us evolving into something different while still retaining the initial integrity of the zine. Over the past year or so we have been collaborating with other companies and groups that we feel represent our lifestyle such as We Ride By Train (train and graffiti lifestyle) and Lost Kawz (drum n bass / festival scene).</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h4>In a fast-paced age with a growing virtual reality, we’re often only a click away from missing some of the most fascinating moments in time. How have you grown and evolved in a changing, digital industry? Why is print media so important?</h4>\n\n<p>We have always had some kind of web presence, whether it was on Myspace or launching our own website, we use multiple social media platforms to promote our work. But at the end of the day social media has no real substance if there’s no physical content that you can put in someone’s hands. I would like to maintain that integrity of print, even if it may not be the main thing we promote.</p>\n\n<p><cms-plugin title="Image - Issue-4_dojillo-1024x659.png" alt="Image - Issue-4_dojillo-1024x659.png " id="232"></cms-plugin></p>\n\n<h4>Tell us about the Nsub project specifically, and how will it compare to The Nsubordinate. What do you hope to accomplish with this new project?</h4>\n\n<p>The new project is really about rebranding it into something that is more relatable to people who pick it up. The content is still revolving around underground street graffiti culture, but what I would like to accomplish is to connect it with all the other aspects and cultures that is connected with it with such as music and partying. Artists of all types have always congregated together in spaces where there is music and people dancing regardless of the medium that the artists use.</p>\n\n<h4>Many people overlook the correlation between graffiti and underground music and festival culture. Why is it important to bring these things together?</h4>\n\n<p><cms-plugin title="Image - issue-1-cover-635x1024.jpg" alt="Image - issue-1-cover-635x1024.jpg " id="233"></cms-plugin></p>\n\n<p>Back in the 60s and 70s when graffiti was first being established in New York people were getting together on the street or warehouses throwing parties, many times these parties renegades and completely illegal. This was truly the foundation of hip-hop, these gatherings is where all the different art forms such as breakdancing, graffiti, DJ Ing, and MCing got together.  Overtime people moved from hip-hop on the street and into the house music in the club scene; the disco and hip hop scenes really took off in the 70s. House Music grew out of disco in chicago and New York and then San Francisco was during the 80s. Underground culture is really all connected from the street to the clubs to the festivals. It’s really just about people coming together and enjoying art forms.</p>\n\n<h4>Give us a run down on the team and who your contributors are. Any other crews that you regularly collaborate with?</h4>\n\n<p>I am the main editor (deftronism) but the other main founder (mr. Epox) happens to live in Ecuador now.   Some of the other main contributors are Marco “the bastard artist” Bhimani and Mike “mikesumoto” Herana. There have been many contributors in the past all who I consider good friends, but we’re always looking to include new people to grow our base and family.</p>\n\n<h4>Why do you feel it’s important to actively travel and explore?</h4>\n\n<p>One of the most important aspects about showcasing photography in a magazine is that in order to get great content you have to take great trips and meet some great people in the process. Otherwise you’ll be stuck doing the same thing over and over. Traveling keeps the mind fresh and brings innew ideas simply by visiting new places and keeping you young at heart.</p>\n\n<h4>Any travel plans for you or the crew coming up? Previous passport stamps?</h4>\n\n<p>This year were planning on taking more trips cross country to like Chicago and Miami. Definitely expect a trip to Asia Europe and back to the Latin American countries this year.  Probably the best trip that we’ve done is to Mexico City and Ecuador in 2012. That was nuts!</p>\n\n<p><cms-plugin title="Image - nsub-5_amuse-126-1024x656.png" alt="Image - nsub-5_amuse-126-1024x656.png " id="234"></cms-plugin></p>\n\n<h4>What about festivals on the books for 2015?</h4>\n\n<p>We do have some festivals plan such as Symbiosis, Moontribe, and some smaller festivals such as Woogie Weekend.</p>\n\n<h4>Do you have a release date for the next issue?</h4>\n\n<p>The next issue officially drops <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/112024145804313/">July 25th in LA as part of a collaboration party with Lost Kawz Lifestyle</a> who are bringing the drum and bass and underground sounds.</p>\n\n<h4>Any last shouts and daps you’d like to give:</h4>\n\n<p>First I’d like to thank everyone who’s ever given me content or asked to be involved in what I do.<br>\nSecond I’d like to thank all the people that of help me produce this project and keep it going. we can keep doing this. we got this. Big ups to the Lost Kawz!</p>

824	<p>Say you love drum and bass at any SoCal desert party and you’ll likely hear one name in response: Dela. One of the main residents of the Moontribe Collective and crew, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/moontribe.dela">Dela Moontribe</a> has been holding down both broken beats and downtempo at their monthly full moon gatherings for years now. The gatherings have been some of the most consistent underground parties in So Cal since the 90’s and even through weather restrictions, venue changes, and technical difficulties, they always manage to pull off amazing events. The DJs cover multiple genres, which makes every month and entirely new experience. Drum and bass is the desert can be a hard thing to find, and <a href="https://soundcloud.com/delamoontribe">Dela Moontribe</a> has played a huge role in securing its presence at outdoor gatherings. She has also helped to bring in some new, slightly dusty faces to the Holllywood and Downtown scenes. Of course, balance is everything, and we caught up with Dela to ask her some more about her musical styles, her crew, and the community.</p>\n\n<h4>Tell us about your history with electronic music. When did you first start DJing, and have you always played drum and bass?</h4>\n\n<p>I started DJing downtempo around 1999. Brad (Moontribe) taught me most of the technical &amp; artistic aspects and I was further schooled in what mind-blowing music sounded like at the Full Moon Gatherings by all the other Moontribe DJs. I started buying downtempo because there was less of that around than other music. And I thought it would be fun to make some chill mixtapes to share with friends. I had no interest in DJing in front of people.</p>\n\n<p>Or course, that eventually changed. I branched from downtempo/midtempo into dubstep in late 2008 and finally couldn’t ignore all the good drum and bass I was hearing by the fall of 2010. I had been a drum and bass fan in the mid-90s, but could never find any stuff I wanted to spin when I was first DJing. Buying online really changed that</p>\n\n<h4>What other genres do you play or produce?</h4>\n\n<p>I play most kinds of bass music . . . downtempo, midtempo, dubstep, and some trap &amp; future bass. I produce with the help of my good friend Brian Saitzyk (also known as Eastern Sun). We have a collaborative project called Trikaya and are almost finished with an EP.</p>\n\n<p>Where do you draw inspiration from – outside of music?</p>\n\n<p>Yoga, dancing, nature, painting, massage, &amp; coffee (lol)</p>\n\n<h4>For junglists who might not know, tell us a bit about the Moontribe Collective &amp; what it represents.</h4>\n\n<p>Moontribe is a community of people that come together to honor Love and Life through a ritual celebration of the full moon. We hold space for each other to come explore things like: who we are, what we believe in, what inspires us, what our boundaries are, who our friends are, how to be a better person, how to love each other — you know, hippy stuff.</p>\n\n<p><cms-plugin title="Image - 1526494_912481132108165_4935224345512327535_n-e1435689868702.jpg" alt="Image - 1526494_912481132108165_4935224345512327535_n-e1435689868702.jpg " id="825"></cms-plugin></p>\n\n<p>The DJs and organizers volunteer their time, the gatherings are funded by donations, and the money collected only goes towards making the gatherings happen (equipment, land rental, insurance, etc). The volunteers generally are people who have been inspired/touched/transformed by their experience at the gatherings and feel the desire to help out. Some of those volunteers become integral to the gatherings and end up becoming organizers. It’s a very organic process.</p>\n\n<p>Just celebrated our 22-year anniversary. We’ve had so many people deeply involved over that time, but no one that was at the organizing core at the beginning is still an organizer now. We’ve had to learn how to pass Moontribe — the idea, the ritual, and the vibration –from one generation to another. It’s kind of an amazing thing.</p>\n\n<p><cms-plugin title="Snippet - delamoon tribe" alt="Snippet - delamoon tribe " id="826"></cms-plugin></p>\n\n<h4>Have you always received support for playing drum and bass?</h4>\n\n<p>I think there was always some support because people in Moontribe are wonderfully open-minded to good music. Even so, I think it took a bit of time for real enthusiasm to build because it was pretty unfamiliar territory at first. People literally needed to learn a new way of dancing. But I was confident that they would enjoy the freedom and ecstatic nature of dancing to DnB. When I first played DnB in the desert, it was never by itself — I always mixed in some dubstep or midtempo. Over time people have become genuine lovers of the genre AND so many dnb heads have started showing up at the gatherings.</p>\n\n<p>I should add that the crowd and the dance floor’s reaction to different kinds of music shapes how I play DnB. One of the things I love about DJing is the feeling of give and take between the dancers and the DJ. I play what I think are cool tracks and the dancers tell me how fun those tracks are to dance to. Over time I’ve gotten a feel for what they like and I try to mix that with interesting new sounds so the dance floor experience remains fresh and fun for everyone.</p>\n\n<p><cms-plugin title="Snippet - delamoon tribe live may" alt="Snippet - delamoon tribe live may " id="827"></cms-plugin></p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h4>Do you see your DnB influence in the desert affecting the LA scene as a whole?</h4>\n\n<p>Ha ha — I don’t think I’m having much influence in the LA scene. But then again, I don’t frequent much stuff in the city beyond the occasional Respect or Bassrush event, so I have no idea. But I do hope I’ve helped open the minds/ears of a few dancers out there! It’s a shame to be closed to a genre with such depth.</p>\n\n<h4>Is there a divide between the desert and “Hollywood” DnB scenes? How have you seen this change over time?</h4>\n\n<p>Yes, there’s definitely a divide. I don’t think it’s changed because DnB just didn’t really exist in the desert for most of the last couple decades. There were people like Daniel that played some here and there, but not a consistent presence.</p>\n\n<h4>What other countries have you played in? Craziest event?</h4>\n\n<p>Canada, Mexico, Egypt, and Australia.<br>\nThere are so many ways to define crazy – lol!</p>\n\n<p>I think one of my pivotal experiences was seeing Skream play in The Village at the Shambhala Music Festival in Canada. It was the first time I experienced dubstep on such a giant system and it made me really understand how psychedelic and powerful the music — specifically the bass — could be. That experience partially informs how I play DnB today.</p>\n\n<p>My favorite dance experience this year was dancing for hours and hours at Rainbow Serpent in Australia — that was SOOOO much fun!</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h4>How important do think international influence is? What do you think sets Southern California apart on a global scale?</h4>\n\n<p>I don’t spend much time thinking about international influence… What I DO know is that every scene has its own personality and vibration. No one scene is better than any other — we’re all just a little different — that’s what makes the world such a fun place to explore.</p>\n\n<p>I like playing for the SoCal desert family because I feel like there’s a real enjoyment of serious, sophisticated, psychedelic music. People aren’t afraid of slightly dark, experimental, or high-energy music — they know how to let loose and go for it — I love it! It’s so inspiring to play for and dance with our people!</p>\n\n<h4>Any summer travel plans or shows you’d like to mention coming up?</h4>\n\n<p>I’m excited to be returning to both the Firefly Gathering in Arizona in June and the Spectrum Festival in Alaska in July. I’ll be playing a show put on by the Mother Earth Sound System crew in Denver at the end of August, which I’m looking forward to because I’d like to connect more with fellow bass music enthusiasts out there.</p>\n\n<p>I’m also trying to find a way to bridge the gap that exists between what happens in our desert scene and the larger festival scene. I feel like there is potential to cultivate a greater appreciation for DnB, but it might take a special custom blend of fun, energy, and beats. We’ll see – ha ha!</p>\n\n<p> </p>
692	<div class="imgl"><cms-plugin title="Image - collette-bw-red-4-43.jpg" alt="Image - collette-bw-red-4-43.jpg " id="700"></cms-plugin></div>\n\n<p>For sometime we have been attempting to track down the ever radiant Collette Warren in hopes of gaining some insight to her involvement in the drum and bass industry. In the last few years she has been taking the scene by storm working with some of the oldest as well as freshest producers in the community. We were eager to pick her brain in anticipation of the new Intrigue 13 Anniversary Collection dropping March 18, 2015. Having watched her momentum over the last few years in the scene she is quickly becoming recognized as a force to be reckoned with in a typically male dominated genre.</p>\n\n<p>Name :<br>\nCollette Warren</p>\n\n<p>Place of birth:<br>\nBirmingham, UK</p>\n\n<p>Years as an MC:<br>\n5 years</p>\n\n<p>Countries Toured:<br>\nUK, North America, Brazil, New Zealand, Italy, Vienna, Slovakia, Poland, Bulgaria</p>\n\n<p>Were you involved with music prior to becoming a singer/ vocalist?<br>\nI’ve been singing all my life in various different ways, when I was younger I used to be in lots of musicals as I love acting also. Then I went on to write acoustic music and I used to tour with a guitar player and that’s when my confidence really grew as a solo performer.</p>\n\n<p>Who inspired you to push being an MC for electronic music?<br>\nI’ve been a drum &amp; bass fanatic since I was 13 and a raver since I was 15, and singing was always a big part of my life, but I just didn’t believe in myself enough! It was actually MC Tali that first believed in me, so she gave me the confidence I needed to go forward in my music career. It all started we went to the Miami winter conference,  I was walking around singing in the hotel, she said, “oh my god Collette, your voice is amazing, I had no idea you sang!” She told me I had to do something with my voice and I wanted to but I wasn’t confident at all at that point, she said that we should work together and then a few months later she asked me to be the backing singer in her jazz band ‘Rogue Noveau’. After a couple of years of touring my confidence grew and I was ready to be at the forefront again!</p>\n\n<p>I knew that I wanted to be a drum &amp; bass vocalist ever since I heard the Lady roller from the ez rollers when I was a teenager, but I just needed that first tune. Then one day I was singing at my friends wedding, Keria &amp; Tim and my friend Freddie (FD) was there and heard me sing; He asked me to record my first track “Want You” which appeared on Lenzman &amp; Riya’s Metalheadz podcast, at that point I decided this is what I wanted to do!</p>\n\n<p>What is your involvement with the new intrigue album?<br>\nSo I have a track on there with the lovely Random Movement called ‘Same Old Feelings’ and I’m really happy about that as I love Intrigue and I’ve always wanted to work with Random Movement so a double whammy!</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p>Do you have any tour dates for the new album release?<br>\nYes I’ll be touring with Ben Soundscape, one half of The Insiders and the head honcho at Intrigue! I hosted The Insiders set at the Intrigue 13th Birthday party and album launch which was an amazing night down at Thekla in Bristol, and we are also heading to the US in May to play at the West Coast Weekender in San Diego, which I’m so excited about as it’s the first one so it’s an honor to be part of! And then we’ll be back to the US in the summer to carry on touring the album.</p>\n\n<p>There are very few female vocalists in Drum and Bass. What drives you to excel in such a male-dominated genre?<br>\nYes, drum &amp; bass is a male dominated genre,  it always will be, and I’m fine with that, but these days more &amp; more amazing, talented women are coming through, it’s great and refreshing. And for me it’s not really about trying to excel in a male dominated scene, it’s more about just trying to excel full stop, for the love of music &amp; singing. In some ways it’s to my advantage being a woman, as there are hardly any in the scene it can be a novelty sometimes and people get excited by that, but it also has its disadvantages, as you are not always taken seriously as a woman in this scene unfortunately and there is a lot of politics, but we won’t go into that now.</p>\n\n<p>How established do you feel at this point in your career? Do you feel you have only scratched the surface of your potential?<br>\nI have definitely only scratched the surface of my potential and establishment in music! I still feel so new to all this and like I’ve still got so far to go. Sometimes I wish I would of started out younger, but everything happens in the right time and I just wasn’t ready then.</p>\n\n<p>What are some of your most notable performances and releases to date?<br>\nOooohh that’s a tough question as there are so many, but one of them has to be when I played in Brazil earlier this year, it was such a dream come true to perform there and the fans in Brazil are the best in the world, they made me feel like a star and it was so humbling and it was the first time that I thought some of these people have actually come out to see me, it was such a nice feeling! I was doing a live show so it was a PA of all my own tracks and these are the gigs that I love to do; it’s a showcase of me &amp; my music and that is why I’m in this game ya know?<br>\nAs for stand out releases, well it has to be ‘Desire’ with Skeptical as it came out on my favorite label Soul:r and this is the tune that got me where I am today and is the track everyone knows me for!</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p>What advice do you have for young women trying to emerge or boost their careers as a female vocalist in the scene?<br>\nI would say get your face out there and get to know people, and then you’ll have your contacts and then your half way there. I used to go raving every weekend up &amp; down the country and I got to know a lot of people so when it come to trying to emerge into a vocalist, I already had all the contacts. Also, don’t give up and the main thing is to believe in yourself and don’t let the fact that you are a woman deter you in this male dominated scene, use it to your advantage!</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p>Any shouts?<br>\nShouts out to Ben at Intrigue for all your support and help! Shouts to the Lost Kawz Lifestyle crew for putting this interview together and of course shouts to all the fans out there that have supported me and keep me doing what I’m doing as without you I wouldn’t be still doing this! Big love to you all!</p>\n\n<p><cms-plugin title="Snippet - collette" alt="Snippet - collette " id="694"></cms-plugin></p>

828	<div><a href="https://www.facebook.com/GerraandStone">Gerra &amp; Stone</a>, the drum &amp; bass production duo hailing from the U.K., has pushed their abilities to the next level with their most recent release, the Unbreakable EP on <a href="https://www.dispatchrecordings.com/">Dispatch Recordings</a>.</div>\n\n<p>The EP’s title track delivers a finely crafted mix of chilled-out liquid vibes and a no-nonsense bassline, giving the otherwise calm track an aggressive edge that will undoubtedly keep partygoers on their toes. The tune starts out innocently enough with a hypnotic drum break led by the soothing vocals of Lucy Kitchen and ambient piano strokes of Stephen McCleery, but suddenly takes on a deliciously sultry vibe past the drop. As the low end assumes a darker tone, distorted riffs cut through the mix, perfectly contrasting the piano and vocal elements of the track.</p>\n\n<p><cms-plugin title="Snippet - gs" alt="Snippet - gs " id="829"></cms-plugin></p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p>Side B features the absolute weapon of a tune ‘Plates,’ boasting heavy subs driven by a relentless drum break reminiscent of the early days of drum &amp; bass. The meticulous drum work paired with a heavy sub and splashy reese creates a vast, dangerous soundscape that listeners can easily open their minds and get lost to. It is safe to say that Gerra &amp; Stone have done an excellent job of paying homage to the long history of drum &amp; bass while still pushing their own modern, signature sound.</p>\n\n<p>‘Tender Touch’ and ‘Release My Soul’ -deep rollers that have been laced with lush, liquid vibes and peppered with professionalism- serve us with the attention to detail, organization, and integrity that keeps labels and listeners yearning for more. The final track of the EP is the haunting ‘Almost U,’ which takes listeners on a melancholic journey through sound. Drawn out vocals, muffled horns, and a floaty piano give this tune its addictive, solemn tone.</p>\n\n<p><cms-plugin title="Snippet - gsdt" alt="Snippet - gsdt " id="830"></cms-plugin></p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p>As Gerra &amp; Stone continue to perfect their art, hopefully we will see more releases in the same vein as the ‘Unbreakable EP.’ As a whole, the EP provides listeners and partygoers with an emotional mix of summer romance and dark, techy vibes. Dispatch Recordings is well known for their adherence to immaculate production standards and artistic integrity, both of which DIS092 is absolutely teeming with.</p>\n\n<p>Words: Brian Johnsen</p>
608	<p>In a far-off place where few often think of as a travel destination, the pristine beaches of Pula, Croatia now host the once-underground festival known as <a href="http://www.outlookfestival.com/">Outlook</a>. Now in its 8th year, Outlook Festival is shaping up to be once again the most revered parties of the year. With summer fast approaching, festival goers are quickly making plans to escape from the hustle and bustle of the 9 to 5 work grind and disconnecting from all problems life has been thrown their way. The once-intimate gathering has blown up on a scale never seen before, and now features the biggest acts in underground sound. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/outlookfestival">Outlook Festival</a> artists demand the highest level of musical quality in dub, reggae, hip-hop, drum ‘n’ bass, garage, grime, dubstep, house, techno and electronica.</p>\n\n<p><cms-plugin title="Image - Outlook-Festival-2014-Dan-Medhurst-5836.jpg" alt="Image - Outlook-Festival-2014-Dan-Medhurst-5836.jpg " id="610"></cms-plugin></p>\n\n<p>With the final lineup announcements complete and boat party lineups finally released, the stacked lineup leaves little room for phony DJs and lip-syncing vocalists. Recently added to the bill are some true originators, including Beanie Man the “King of Dancehall”, The Beatnuts, Hyrogliphics, Digital Mystikz, SBTRKT, DJ hype, Shy Fx and Congo Natty, Renegade Hardware 20 year Set (feat. Loxy &amp; Ink), Break and KYO, Goldie, Ant TC1, Mc DRS, SP MC, and too many more to mention. With so many talented artists, the most difficult part of the party won’t be booking flights, making travel arrangements, or even catching afternoon boat parties- it will be trying to be in two places at once! From our past visits to Outlook, the most difficult part of the weekend has always been planing out an itinerary of the boat parties and talent not to be missed.</p>\n\n<p><cms-plugin title="Snippet - outlook festival" alt="Snippet - outlook festival " id="611"></cms-plugin></p>\n\n<p>For a visual representation of the festival, this year’s Outlook highlight video is sure to send chills down every hopeful attendee’s back. The sheer excitement that’s generated from the impeccable videography in this year’s trailer shows what Outlook festival 2015 is all about. From ram-jammed boat parties to afternoons on the beach, and week-long activities to entertain every festival goer, there is never a shortage of excitement. The core values of what the festival was founded on are “sound system culture” and underground music. It’s no question why some have continued to come on this bass music pilgrimage every year. Every aspect of the festival is designed to blow minds and promote personal transformation- not through yoga workshops of healing seminars-  but through the most profound, upfront, no-gimmicks beats presented by the absolute masters of the underground. If you have any doubt about summer travel plans, do not hesitate to catch some festival videos or check the <a href="https://soundcloud.com/outlookfestival">Outlook Festival soundcloud</a> for some of the legendary sets that have graced the 2000 year old Roman Amphitheater. Prepare for the transformational transcendence that is Outlook Festival.</p>\n\n<p><cms-plugin title="Image - Outlook-Festival-credit-Dan-Medhurst-4.jpg" alt="Image - Outlook-Festival-credit-Dan-Medhurst-4.jpg " id="612"></cms-plugin></p>\n\n<p> </p>
641	<p>In a surreal setting alongside a pristine river outside the city of Vancouver, Canada is a festival that in the past seven years has grown from a tight gathering of friends in Squamish, BC to a “immersive multimedia environment”. This summer, the landscape comes to life July 10-13 for what is sure to be another transformational experience. The organizers consistently strive to book world renowned DJs, musicians, and producers from across the globe to promote the absolute best in underground sound. Although festival has gained international status, since their inception they continue to preserve the seamless and inspiring vibes that are known as <a href="http://basscoast.ca/">Bass Coast</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Year after year, the festival showcases all styles of forward-thinking music, and this year’s line up is stacked with some of the most innovative and cutting edge producers in drum and bass, dubstep and bass music. Some of this years stand out names include OmUnit, J. Kenzo Sinistarr, EPROM, Sam Binga, Diamond Saints, and Justin Martin in addition to a well-rounded spectrum of local talent. With the festival just weeks away, tickets are still available for what is sure to be another wicked time with progressive individuals. Bass Coasts’ crew of builders and volunteers are already on site incorporating over 50 art and visual installations throughout the festival grounds. This years massive PK sound systems and attention to detail from the entire crew is sure to leave some festival goers searching for their marbles come Monday.</p>
652	<p><img>Every year during summer there is an onslaught of parties all week as well as festivals every weekend; with so many events every week it becomes hard to differentiate what all these events and gatherings represent. Every promoter attempts to bring a different angle or special headliner to entice people to drop what they are doing and cut lose for the weekend. From the blinding led displays, drugs, crowds, headliners, sound systems and over the top venues many of these events simply tend to blur together. With every event trying to out do the next, what is really accomplished? In the past few years after touring many festivals around the world one that constantly shines and a beacon of hope in all aspects of sounds, culture, and community is Bass Coast festival in Merrit, BC.</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p>Although the festival has since out grown its original home in Squamish BC to a large more accommodating home in Merrit the festival organizers have yet to lose sight of the core values and principles of what make this a truly intimate music driven festival. The entire organization is built from a community of like minded people with pure positive intention to present the finest in craftsman ship. This year there was no shortage of master builders in art, stage design, production, and beats.</p>\n\n<p>The lineup was not rammed with the hottest names in the industry but more so carefully tailored with beat makers pushing the most obscure left of genera representation to compliment the sounds of the local and emerging talent from bc and canada.</p>\n\n<p>The entire lay out of the festival has changed from our last visit to Bass Coast, the layout and camping has all been moved to the trees with artist and staff camping was tucked between Slay bay and the Radio stage. This area hosts all the people that make the festival tick and with everyone camped close together it was easy to see people running to check into shifts or artist gearing up for sets. There were many other great additions this year which included vendors at The Cafe; placed between the main stage and art displays and clothing vendors. The cafe offered a variation of food and at any time meals could be found all weekend hot and ready from burgers, to Thai there was no shortage of quality ingredients and gourmet style food for vegan and meat lovers alike. The taco truck also had some stand out sets with some late night drum and bass which may have been one of the best selections of the weekend.</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p>Friday night was buzzing with people happy to unwind from the work week and after tents shades and hammocks were set up you could find people wandering to the stages and getting a feel for the weekend to come. Some of the stand out sets from the night were Degga Sound,  and Eradik on the radio stage seemed to set the tone for the night with 160 juke footwork to minimal dubwise and 170 vibes kept people moving well into the sun rise. We managed to catch a few words with Vancouver Local and Bass Coast veteran Eradik of the SHAHdjs for some insight on what Bass Coast means to him.</p>\n\n<p>JM: What is one of your favorite Bass Coast experiences?</p>\n\n<p>Eradik: Favorite experience was 2012 the last year in Squamish. It was the first year my partner JF killah and I played the main stage. The over all vibe and stage design and crowd was really into it for a sun down set 8-10 we followed a group called the fungineers. Personally I was a little nervous playing the main stage for an audience of a lot of personal friends and people from Vancouver. But hands down one of the coolest stages and memorable experiences, I am really happy they are having me back!</p>\n\n<p>JM: What are you hyped on this year?</p>\n\n<p>Eradik: This year i’m really excited to be playing after Degga Sound they are really good friends from Van. Stoked to be playing a lot of originals this year it will be really nice to showcase all the music I have been working really hard on. Catch me Saturday morning 4 am to 5 am.</p>\n\n<p>JM: Anyone other artist you are looking forward to seeing?</p>\n\n<p>Eradik: Hyped for Sam Binga.!! It really nice to see OmUnit back again as well as Sinistarr. Over all I’m just really happy to connect with a lot of friends that I have not seen in some time, seems like this year all the peeps came out so should be an amazing time.</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p>From impressive art installations to clothing vendors from all over Canada, there was no shortage of things to update your wardrobe with   and trip-out on. With the Bass Coast organization continuing to push quality. The slay bay stage was  located right next to the river and it was great to dance  barefoot in the lush grass every afternoon to some warm daytime vibes. From the river you could always hear the crisp PK sound vibrating the cleanest bass driven beats all afternoon and the bar located next to the stage made it easy to grab a drink without having to walk back to camp.</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p>Saturday night all attention seemed to be on the main stage with Justin Martin drawling a huge crowd. However the highlight of the evening was the over all display and attention to detail for the main stage, and enormous tentacle structure would host the main stage acts and the massive open area made it easy to comfortably dance. Stand out sets from OmUnit who showcased much of what was on his new album and an across the board versatile set from Sinistarr would close out the night on the main stage.</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p>On Sunday afternoon we managed to catch up with Sam Binga upon his arrival to get a few words on his thoughts about this years Bass Coast and some insight on what he would be bringing to the festival.</p>\n\n<p>JM: What brought you to Bass Coast?</p>\n\n<p>SB: Air Canada…</p>\n\n<p>JM: What have you heard about Bass Coast?</p>\n\n<p>SB: Ive heard some really great things about this place, Om Unit has been singing the praises about this festival for a long time. I really like the fact that the camping and the stages are mixed in together, its a lot different than festivals I have been to. There seems to be a real sense of community. Its nothing like big festivals where you finish at the stage then you have a three hour hike back to you tent which is always over like three hills. It nice to see that everything here is all tied together. Also a huge fan of all the many amazing outfits that people are sporting around. Over all just a BEAUTIFUL Location.!</p>\n\n<p>JM: So whats on the menu for tonight, what type of music do you have in mind for your set tonight?</p>\n\n<p>SB: It depends on what the guy before me plays, we’ll see what going down I like to play it by ear no pieticular set in mind. I have a bunch of new stuff that i would like to play some new things I would like to try out. Also because I have never played here before I would like to play some of the bigger tunes that I’ve had come out over the last couple years, which I wouldn’t play out every set in the Uk just because people have heard it loads. Since this is my first time here maybe show people how I play my tunes, sort of like this was quite a big tune and this is how I present it. Also have some V.I.P’s and things as well.</p>\n\n<p>JM: What would you consider or define as your sound? It doesn’t seem to fit in conventional subgenera’s.</p>\n\n<p>SB: Im not sure that I would like to. I feel there are certain elements or aesthetics that you should stick to. They carry through most of what I do. I always try and keep good drums and bring interesting sounds like a lot of dirt, grit, hiss, and mistakes; I like a lot of mistakes in my music, not stuff that goes out of time; more so trying to make a wrong thing into a right thing. A lot of stuff nowadays is so precise and so clean, I try and react against that. I like my stuff sounding a bit weird or wrong, I’ve been listening to a lot of house and techno now and that stuff is really about the weird distortion, the lowfi cassette feel. I think there is a lot of room to bring that into what i am doing. I also try and avoid stuff thats obvious, certain things are always going to work, such as a big drum roll or big build up people love that shit, but i try and do things in a more round about way. I also avoid trying to be overly dark, a lot of drum and bass is super dark and people love that. So I try and shy way from that, and lots of Hip hop influence such as the Neptune’s, Timberland and Dirty South producers.</p>\n\n<p>JM: How do you feel about edits?</p>\n\n<p>SB: How do i feel about edits… I think if they do a good job, wicked I’m all for it. Its quite nice to hear a new different version of your track. However most of the ones I have been sent have been terrible, I have not heard any peiticular amazing ones. I don’t want to diss anyone who have done an edit on one of my tracks; if your going to do something to it, you should bring something different to the table and at least to the same standard as the original. Ive done edits, I did the Sambaata edit and with that I took it in a total different direction. I feel its a huge part of dance music culture, remixing shit and editing stuff are a big part of it. You have to do them well because you are competing with a track that you love so it important to do it well.</p>\n\n<p>JM: What type of things do you try and apply to progress your sound?</p>\n\n<p>SB: I don not like to try and repeat myself to much, there are always things that i try and explore, however every time i go down that path or a different direction I try and make sure it is different than the last. Rather than like “ok that worked, lets do the same thing again.” I suppose it comes to personal standards, a lot of people become happy with one way of doing things and tend to get stuck, so i see it more as a personal need to progress my sound.</p>\n\n<p>JM: Whats in the works for the future and the rest of the year?</p>\n\n<p>SB: Fairly big project coming at the end of summer, that should be with Critical been working hard on that so I’m hoping that will go down well. I also have some good stuff Ive been working on with OmUnit. Im always working on things but as far as releases that whats coming up, ill just continue keeping on.</p>\n\n<p>JM: Any other big parties or festivals this year?</p>\n\n<p>SB: I was at Glastonbury earlier this year, that was loads of fun. Also Fusion festival in Germany, one in Poland coming up few other bits and bobs here and there.</p>\n\n<p>JM: Any Shouts?</p>\n\n<p>SB: Thanks to the Bass Coast organization for having me out, and shouts to everyone who continues to support.</p>\n\n<p>From begging to end this years Bass Coast was packed with more amazing talent than we can note; from the talent, the art, food, friends, stage design, sound systems, and vibes its no surprise why people continue to keep coming back. Even hundred of miles away from our base on SoCal there was a massive sense of community with every person being more friendly and inviting as the next. It might be something in the water but what the Bass Coast organizations continues to do every year is create change and inspire people to disconnect and become whole from the outside to their soul in a surreal setting where negativity and falsity simply melt away. Needless to we were once again blown away in every direction and we will continue to actively promote and support the entire family as they continue to polish the gem now revered as Bass Coast Festival.</p>
719	<h2>Music</h2>
645	<p>For those who walk a different path from mainstream late-night parties, underground music, graffiti art, and outrageous sound systems have always received a short end of the stick. Those of us who feel stuck in the hustle and bustle of the daily grind treasure the moments we can cut loose among like-minded friends. Luckily, every year in a setting that is nothing short of magical, a gathering of thousands of underground music connoisseurs takes place. <a href="http://www.outlookfestival.com/">Outlook Festival</a> is almost like a pilgrimage home for people with one thing in common: the music. Festival culture has become a major industry, and many large events have lost sight of the original focus. Too often the festivals become about money and statistics. Outlook Festival, although now on a much larger scale than when it started, has stayed consistent in their massive stage production, sound systems, and most importantly: in incorporating the most respected names in underground music.</p>\n\n<p><cms-plugin title="Image - 12039122_10153044570346227_2822635877236150703_o-1024x683.jpg" alt="Image - 12039122_10153044570346227_2822635877236150703_o-1024x683.jpg " id="646"></cms-plugin></p>\n\n<p>Outlook Festival jumped off September 2<sup>nd</sup> 2015 with an opening concert in a venue built thousands of years before the styles of music represented were even a thought. The celebration that brought the early arrivals together showcased all the styles of music that the Outlook represents. Water taxis ran throughout the night for those staying on the festival grounds; dropping partiers off at the steps of the 2000-year-old coliseum venue. With such an immaculate set-up, it was easy to see why this was one of the most revered events of the week. Trojan Sound, Jurassic 5, Gentleman’s Dub Club, and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ronisize">Roni Size</a> represented along side Dynamite MC. Jurassic 5 brought traditional hip hop culture and back from the dead all the way from the streets of LA. The energy and love for traditional hip-hop brought the entire audience to their feet. The closing act was left for the man Roni Size, who was accompanied by live singers, Dynamite MC, and a full band. He cut through classics, live PA and dubs, switching the atmosphere to a raw, uninhibited jungle skank-out to round off the night. Most genres are littered with up and comers, however these legends brought intensity and passion that could only be heard from those who helped create the sounds they love.</p>\n\n<p><cms-plugin title="Image - outlookpic3.jpg" alt="Image - outlookpic3.jpg " id="647"></cms-plugin></p>\n\n<p>In terms of production and sound quality, Outlook Festival is truly in a class of its own. They bring together some of the best sound technicians from all over Europe to push sound system culture to the next level. Every stage had a chance to feature multiple styles, and did so without a technical hitch. There was an abundance of great music, enticing people to cut loose and connect on a person-to-person level with fellow peeps under the warm, Croatian summer sky.</p>\n\n<p>The legendary parties at the Moat stage had the place rammed front to back with blinding lights flashing to the beats and breaks. It was a heads-down-low affair inside the Moat for dnb heavy weights Hyrogliphics, Kasra, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/eneiofficial">Enei</a>, Ivy Lab, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/FUNCTIONDIGITAL">Digital</a>, and a salute to the end of a 20-year era for Renegade Hardware on Sunday night. Another highlight from the weekend was on the Garden stage for Levelz Live Pa, Zed bias, Chimpo, and Dub Phizix with an onslaught of MCs such as Skittles, Sparkz, Strategy, and Chunky. With the Mango’s, and the dungeon stage now in different areas; the fort seemed somewhat empty than years prior, but that didn’t stop the beats and vibrations from permeating through the halls in Noah’s ballroom for AntTC1’s 2 hour history set, Gerra and Stone, and unknown heavy weight Nicon and MC Swift.</p>\n\n<p>The festival grounds also hosted two different beach stages that consistently bumped sound throughout the weekend, with a smaller stage warming up every morning just after clean up.  The main beach stage pumped out warm daytime vibes for festivalgoers lounging on the beach or grabbing lunch and cocktails at one of the many food vendors. The 2000-year-old fort Punta Cristo hosted partiers for the festival as well as camping. However, all week long there was trash littered across the grounds every day on the beach and every morning after the final sets. The blatant carelessness of campers was surprising, as we are used to the eco-mindfulness of the California scene. </p>\n\n<p>In a setting so rich in history, the lack of respect for the environment was obvious. Coming from West Coast festival culture, where events pride themselves on being eco-conscious and green, seeing such an amazing venue littered in trash every morning was tragic. Festival organizers have turned somewhat of a blind eye toward the problem over the years, and instead of informing and educating partiers or even providing more waste bins, they assume the responsibility of cleaning up the mess themselves. Though the grounds are cleared eventually, it promotes a careless and selfish mentality of attendees who, at the end of the day, are guests of the foreign country.</p>\n\n<p>With so many standout lineups on this year’s boat parties; this is where Outlook truly shone. Once you experience it, you’ll agree that setting sail on a boat with your favorite artists for intimate sets under the shining sun is a must for any Outlook attendee. With 50 boats departing throughout the weekend, there were just too many to choose from. Most of the artists from the festival covering all spectrums graced the boats with memorable sets. The <a href="http://www.exitrecords.co.uk/">Exit Records </a>boat featured DBridge, Skeptical, Mark System, Fixate, and SPMC.  In the absence of GQ and Fracture, this was truly a collective as SP graced the decks early in the afternoon while System hosted. It was pleasure to see them working it out, while DBridge broadcasted the afternoon’s events via Facebook. Fixate closed the day with back-to-back rewinds from new producer Submarine; who just happened to be on board and had boss man DBridge calling for him at the decks. Start to finish, the day was packed full of dubs unreleased on Exit and forthcoming. It was nice to see a collective of like-minded producers pushing the envelope in Exit Records fashion.</p>\n\n<p><cms-plugin title="Image - outlookcrowd.jpg" alt="Image - outlookcrowd.jpg " id="650"></cms-plugin></p>\n\n<p>The second boat that set sail was hosted by <a href="http://www.renegadehardware.co.uk/">Renegade Hardware</a>. As we all know this year Renegade announced that they would be closing their doors. The truly shocking news set a bit of a somber tone set on the boat. After bright sunny skies all day, the Renegade boat set sail and the legendary crew of Keaton, Loxy, Ink and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/AntTC1">AntTC1</a> brought us into the eye of the storm with all the dark, rainy gloominess of a true UK Renegade night. With the system under cover, the tunes ripped through the speakers bringing thunder and lighting to truly mark the end of an era. The stormy vibes set the tone as the dance floor was pounded with rain. This boat ride was not for the faint hearted, and the true Renegade soldiers who were not phased by the rain stood their ground as the selections pumped and rain poured. For those who never experienced the heyday of <a href="https://www.facebook.com/renegadehardware">Renegade Hardware</a>, this show was everything and more. The boat party marked the dawn of a new begging as some producers decide to step away from drum and bass to venture into new and different projects.</p>\n\n<p>The Clearing was the most centrally located stage that greeted attendees, and the spacious area was packed throughout the weekend. However, the Harbor stage was the main stage, and was set down by the water at the end of a steep path that was an impressive climb back to the top. This largest and most impressive stage featured some of the biggest acts of the weekend. Mount Kimbie, Beenie Man, Dub Phizix &amp; Strategy, Run the Jewels, Congo Natty Feat Congo Dubs, Shy FX &amp; Stamina all brought the finest of their respected genres. Congo Natty sent the place into a frenzy, as they blended between roots reggae, dub, and drum and bass.</p>\n\n<p><cms-plugin title="Image - yeah.jpg" alt="Image - yeah.jpg " id="651"></cms-plugin></p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p>When the music stopped and the last cups were kicked from partiers staggering home, the questions begin to swirl in our heads: what do all these festivals really mean? What is it all for? With empty wallets, lost belongings, sun burns and long flights home, what made Outlook worth the trip half way across the world? We were reminded of why we embarked on the journey in the first place: we were in search of acceptance and freedom. Dancing among the finest names in underground music and connecting with people from all across the world is not an easy thing to find in the SoCal scene. At Outlook Festival, we experienced moments that allowed us to transcend in a soulful celebration of quality sound. Outlook festival granted us the freedom that, in society today, has become so hard to find. From the Fort to the Harbor, Mungo’s to the beach, we were greeted with smiling faces and foreign languages. The vibes of positivity and acceptance radiated through the festival grounds. After a whirlwind weekend of releasing inhibitions, we found ourselves in a setting no short of surreal among people who all appreciated the progressive, bass heavy sounds that we did. This is what set Outlook apart from most other major festivals, and is the sole reason they remain leader in underground music and sound system culture.</p>\n\n<p><cms-plugin title="Image - outlook beach.jpg" alt="Image - outlook beach.jpg " id="649"></cms-plugin></p>

656	<h5><strong>Age: </strong>33</h5>\n\n<h5><strong>Country of Origin: </strong>México</h5>\n\n<p><strong>Label Affiliations:</strong> Monochrome Recordings, Cadence recordings, Omni Music, Luna The Cat, <a href="https://soundcloud.com/breakbeat-rebelz">Breakbeat Rebelz</a>, Danger Chamber Digital, Vibration Records, Soulridaz</p>\n\n<p><strong>How did you find yourself involved with electronic music; was it a love at first listen?</strong></p>\n\n<p>It was around 1996 or 97. I was into graffiti and skateboarding back in the day, some of my friends started listening to IDM and Psychedelic Trance, so I got the opportunity to listen a few sounds from Autechre, AFX, Amon Tobin, stuff like that. One of my best friends was more into drum and bass, so he introduced me to LTJ Bukem. I remember the first drum and bass tune I heard was “Demons Theme” from the man, then “Atlantis” and I instantly fell in love with that sound. I started immediately searching for dnb tunes at Audiogalaxy and Soulseek. Also I started to understand the difference between dnb and jungle, so it was a magical time for me.</p>\n\n<p><strong>When did you find your self gravitating towards drum and bass, and was there a scene when you started listening to jungle/ dnb? Are you into playing other styles?</strong></p>\n\n<p>There wasn’t a scene in my city at that time, and there still isn’t haha, I’m the only guy here producing and playing jungle/dnb in Morelia. People are more into house, trance and techno all the time. It’s hard to make people get into bass music parties, they seem confused when they listen to intelligent dance music and breakbeat inspired music. I also produce dub, ambient and experimental stuff. As I mentioned, I hooked up with dnb in 96-97.</p>\n\n<p><strong>There has been a lot of stigma surrounding Mexico being a very dangerous country to visit. Do you feel this is mostly hype?</strong></p>\n\n<p>hahaha- well, don’t believe the hype! I can’t have an opinion here, ´cause I’ve never been in the US and judging it based off what I see from the media would be dumb. In my country things have changed, it’s not the same place as it used to be 10 – 15 years ago when you could walk the streets at night without worrying. It certainly is a violent place, but the whole damn world is violent. There are violent people everywhere. In México you have to be careful with who you deal with, you have to be wise and patient especially with the mobsters who are almost everywhere. Personally  I live in a quiet place and I try to keep my vibe and frequency in a fearless and zen mood. I avoid going to places where I know I can find trouble without looking for it. You just have to stay alert but not paranoid.</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<div class="imgl"><cms-plugin title="Image - 1239874_10151695218754200_706174676_n.jpg" alt="Image - 1239874_10151695218754200_706174676_n.jpg " id="690"></cms-plugin></div>\n\n<p><strong>How is the scene in your area? There seems to be a revival of drum and bass world wide, have you also been feeling this in Mexico?</strong></p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p>As I mentioned I’m the only guy playing jungle/dnb in Morelia. But yes, you can find a small dnb scene in some of the cities from the rest of the country such as Distrito Federal, Aguascalientes, Guanajuato, Puebla, San Luis Potosí, and Guadalajara. But in my opinion (and this is only my opinion really) I feel the national scene is only into liquid, jump up and neurofunk. There´s a huge lack of intelligent drum and bass, atmospheric jungle, and sub-genres that personally I find more interesting. Also, some of the producers or deejays are jumping into trends. I mean, a lot of them started playing or producing dnb, then jumped to that thing they call “dubstep” (which, by the way, is  not real dubstep) then jumped to trap and then to moombaton and stuff. They take it as fashion and that sucks ass, no soul at all. There are only a few dnb/jungle producers that you can realize the hard work and soul they put in their productions… and I really mean a few- like 4-5 in the whole country.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How is the current economic status, and does it affect the music scene? How are the turnouts for your events? Do people seem to be coming out more than before?</strong></p>\n\n<p>I see myself still making music in the present and in the future, but I don’t see myself throwing events in the future hahahaha. It’s way too much effort and money to invest when people appreciate it. They´re like robots man, they only want their 4×4 music and to get wasted. I really feel  for the 5-10 people that really go to listen to jungle, those who pay for their ticket to PAY ATTENTION AND LISTEN TO MUSIC. This is not just a DJ experience. Jungle, intelligent and atmospheric dnb goes way beyond that in my opinion.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Deriving from the underground, how have you been influenced by other forms of subculture, such as graffiti, hip hop, or other DJs/ producers? Any other hobbies that push your music?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Since 94 I hooked up immediately with graffiti. I love drawing, and I’m also a graphic designer. Graffiti took me into skateboarding, and skateboarding into punk rock and hardcore punk. I also listened to hip hop, jazz music, trip hop and of course breakbeat, where I found dnb and jungle and where all my attention went. I feel mad respect for real deejays- I mean any guy that has the skills to make beatjuggling and scratching, like Mix Master Mike, QBert, Craze, Jurassic5, Shadow, etc. Boxing, skateboarding and meditation inspire me too. Also science fiction movies, and spiritual topics are fully welcome.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What made you want to produce music? Do you feel there is representation of your culture and heritage in the music you are making music?</strong></p>\n\n<p>I think it was immediately when I heard Bukem’s tunes I knew that I had to do it, so I did. A few years later, but I did. I earned money to buy studio monitors and a computer and here I am today. I like to tell stories through my music from experiences from my time in this dimension.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Latin America seems to be a tight circle. What producers are you working with currently, and who do you see progressing the scene both locally and worldwide?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Yes, there´s Dfender (MX), Mukiyare (MX), Hytec (MX), Joakuim (MX-FR). I really enjoy their work and I have some projects in the oven with them. Also Antigravity (MX), he is into a more experimental mood but he’s a kick ass producer. Also BRAIN and Unreal Project from Colombia, Thiago Pery from Brasil, Insaint from Perú are pushing the sounds constantly and making some serious dnb.</p>\n\n<p><strong>With drum and bass now a global industry What do you feel you are doing to put Mexico on the map?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Atmospheric / Intelligent / Jungle / Artcore aesthetics, that´s what I think I’m doing to put MX on the map. Also running a digital label called <a href="https://soundcloud.com/breakbeat-rebelz">Breakbeat Rebelz</a> and pushing this sounds with producers from all the globe.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What labels are you currently working with and have music released or forthcoming on?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Cadence Recordings from Torquay UK, Monochrome Recordings from Poland, Omni Music UK, Vibration Records UK, Luna The Cat from Croatia, Danger Chamber Digital UK, Breakbeat Rebelz MX and Soulridaz MX<b>.</b></p>\n\n<p><strong>You seem to be very busy this year, do you find you spend more time producing or DJing?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Definitely, yes I am a busy guy. I prefer locking up into the studio than going out on weekends, I’m kind of a hermit hahaha. And honestly there´s nothing much that takes my attention in this city. I mean clubs and bars, but in most of those places the sound system sucks ass and it’s not the music I like to hear. So I stay at home and make the music I want to hear, or catch a movie with good company and chill, or reading, drawing, stuff like that.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What would you like to spot light with this guest mix? Anything we should keep an eye out for, possibly some sate side appearances?</strong></p>\n\n<p>This mix contains a few dubs that will be released in 2016, specially from a full length that will be released in CD and digital by Cadence recordings, also a couple remixes I made for MartianMan that I really enjoyed working on.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Any shouts or people that deserve some recognition?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Yes, big ups to Dfender, Mukiyare, Hytec, Joakuim, Antigravity, Electricks, Isaac Maya, Jungle Empire Crew, Urban Bits,  Manrico Montero a.k.a.

654	<p>As summer is coming to a close, there has been no shortage of wild parties, massive festivals, and big tunes on even bigger sound systems. For most with summer drawing to a close its means back to school, work, and some hazy reflecting on the summers expenses. Fortunately here at the Lost Kawz Camp we are just warming up; with the launch of our new series of events RESISTANCE we aimed to bring an underground experience back to the concrete jungle of Southern California. With massive support from the SoCal drum and bass community and quality representation of international talent from around the map this years events so far have been a major success.</p>\n\n<p>After our summer affiliation and collaboration with Outlook Festival to host the west coast launch parties we will once again be back in the place where Sound Systems, Musical talent, and Festival production are held to the highest regard. We are very happy to be back in Pula Croatia for this years Outlook Festival to document the cultural bass music revitalization and renaissance that is 2015. With the Lost Kawz team traveling across Europe once again, this summers project Lucid Kaos aims to document the three of the most prestigious European Drum and Bass festivals. From Outlook Festival in Croatia, Sun and Bass in Sardina, and Sun Beatz in Ibiza we are pleased to bring Lost Kawz West Coast representation back to some of our favorite events and are excited to connect with new and old friends in hopes to bridge the gap between stateside and european subculture.</p>\n\n<p>Catch us across the map this summer loaded with tons of merchendise from hats, hoodies, tees, tanks, and stickers. Be sure and follow us Facebook.com/lostkawzlifestyle or Instagram @lostkawzlifestyle and keep up with this summers Lucid Kaos Tour, as we continue to represent what we do best WRITING GRAFFITI and DRUM AND BASS.! Much love and respect to our network world wide keep it locked summer is just getting started.</p>
655	<p>We checked in with French Dj and producer, Julien Salvi aka Redeyes to gain some insight on his current projects and productions. He was nice enough to put together a summer 2015  mix loaded full of amazing beats and forthcoming music. Founder of Vandal LTD and long time contributor to Vandal records; together SKS and Redeyes seem to set the standard of both obscure and liquid styles of sounds coming out of France as they gear up to continue pushing fresh and innovative styles into 2016. Here is a little run down of what he has in the works; be sure to keep an eye on all things Vandal and hopefully a stateside appearance in the near future.</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p>Name: Julien Salvi</p>\n\n<div class="img">\n<p> </p>\n\n<p>Age: 39</p>\n</div>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p>Country of origin: France</p>\n\n<p>Currently residing: France</p>\n\n<p>LK: When did you get your start with drum and bass?</p>\n\n<p>JS: Around 1996, was deep into Hip Hop and stuff from Mo’Wax or Ninja Tune, and there was some infamous parties named “jungle fever” organized by the Dragon Crew (Le Lutin, Kush, Brooxs…), they brought us the jungle sound, straight from London to Toulouse. So Drum and Bass was just a natural move from hip hop, trip hop to jungle.</p>\n\n<p>LK: You tend to push a various styles of production what do you find your self gravitating towards more?</p>\n\n<p>JS: I reckon if feel more easy or natural to produce “liquid” drum and bass, its something like when I start a tune, it goes from start to the end “easy”, like something natural, I’m not like “mmh what can I do on this part, or should I do a different drop or is this the good snare?” I cant even say it’s a routine, I got this music under my skin so that’s why maybe I rarely got blockers when I want to write a liquid tune.</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p>LK: What is your connection with Vandal Records how long have you been involved?</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p>My friend SKS from Toulouse created it 10 years ago, and I helped him as signing a tune on it,and we decided to do something serious with the label together around 2012/2013, we released my 2d album and worked hard on a tight and good schedule, with confirmed artists (Nickbee, Random Movement, Detail,…) or up and coming artists (Hyroglifics, Tim Reaper, Lockjaw, …) One year ago we created a sub label “Vandal LTD” I’m more in charge of that and we try and push more deep and creative focused music.</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p>LK: Is there a specific sound that is being pushed with the label?</p>\n\n<p>JS: Definitely, Vandal Records is aimed to the dancefloor, it can be dark, rolling, deep, neuro, minimal as it can work on a dancefloor and make the dj happy.</p>\n\n<p>Vandal Limited has no boundaries, its certainly more musical but I don’t want it to be just a liquid funk label, I want it to be creative, innovative, if you just take a look at the releases, its been rarely the same vibe releases after releases.</p>\n\n<p>LK: With the industry always changing what have you done to remain consistent and fresh?</p>\n\n<p>JS: 1. Hard work, 2.  Never sleeping on what we do, 3. Always trying to create, 4. Most important: having fun!!! We just do what we love with people we love/like/believe in.</p>\n\n<p>LK: What changes have you noticed the most within bass music in the last 5 years?</p>\n\n<p>JS: Technology! I Remember when I started out as a DJ; I never had enough money to buy turntables, I couldn’t save money because I was buying too many records each weeks, a plate is 10$.. Today with an mp3, controller, its affordable to everybody; you can build a playlist with 20$!! And it’s the same thing for the producers, I m part of the first “software generation” I just needed a laptop (even a cheap one) and some monitors (or even headphones) to make a tune, but the generation before me had to deal with a hardware, a studio, I know the sound isn’t as good with a “laptop studio” but I could afford one.</p>\n\n<div class="imgl"><cms-plugin title="Image - Redeyes1-300x168.jpg" alt="Image - Redeyes1-300x168.jpg " id="698"></cms-plugin></div>\n\n<p>LK: Do you feel that the emergence of 170, footwork, juke, and dubstep, have been positive for the dnb 175 scene?</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p>JS: Absolutely, drum and bass is a music that has been fed with so many influences and genres, it was the ultimate fusion, so its always fresh and exciting when there are some new vibes added to the genre.</p>\n\n<p>LK: What do you currently have in the works? Any collaborations we should look out for?</p>\n\n<p>JS: Im currently working on the volume 2 of “Memory Lane” which may have a guest appearance from Roygreen &amp; Protone and LaMeduza, there also may be a special collaboration for the next SKS &amp; Signs Ep on Vandal Records, and I’m also working on the futures releases for Vandal LTD. I am also working on some downtempo stuff with my alias RDY*$.</p>\n\n<p>LK: Any summer travel plans tours or dates people should keep an eye out for?</p>\n\n<p>JS: Im still looking out for my first US tour.</p>\n\n<p>I’ll be playing in Prague on the 4<sup>th</sup> September and doing a special Vandal Records night in Toulouse the 12<sup>th</sup> September at the mighty Bikini.</p>\n\n<p>LK: Big ups for the Mix. Any thing you wanted to highlight or point out stuff you played that is forthcoming?</p>\n\n<p>JS: I just wanted to do  a summer vibes mix, something that fit with our last LP on Vandal LTD “Modern Soul”, proper liquid funk business.</p>\n\n<p>LK: Any Last shouts or Big Upz.?</p>\n\n<p>JS: Big up to all the artists who have been working with us at Vandal, to Generic, our Canadian partner for the artworks, to SKS for the fun times and the great meals while we are working on the label.</p>\n\n<p>To keep up with Redeyes and all things Vandal, give them a follow on Facebook, Soundcloud, and on there website.</p>\n\n<p><cms-plugin title="Image - redeyes2-300x300.jpg" alt="Image - redeyes2-300x300.jpg " id="687"></cms-plugin></p>\n\n<p><a href="https://soundcloud.com/djredeyes">https://soundcloud.com/djredeyes</a></p>\n\n<p><a href="https://soundcloud.com/djredeyes">http://vandalrecords.net/</a></p>\n\n<p><a href="https://soundcloud.com/vandal-records">https://soundcloud.com/vandal-records</a></p>\n\n<p><a href="https://soundcloud.com/vandal-records">https://www.facebook.com/vandalrecordsHQ?fref=ts</a></p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p>-Jay Morris</p>

660	<div>Charging right out of the gates this season is the ‘Intrigue 13’ compilation album that has completely shattered all expectations. The Bristol-based drum &amp; bass label has been doing it across the pond with their night for 13 years now, with Ben Soundscape at the helm. After giving this album the standard listen, the Intrigue 13 compilation album has been nothing short of a surprisingly versatile drum &amp; bass delight. The most notable features of this album are easily its deep bass lines and strategically pulled instrument samples that give each of the tracks their lush, sultry atmosphere. Distant guitar licks and jazzy keys laid over technically clean breaks give many of these tunes such an organic essence that it almost seemed as though they were a natural part of my environment.</div>\n\n<p>The album boasts a carefully articulated progression, starting off with mellower, vibey tunes, such as Break’s strangely warm and bright “Winter Rain,” then breaking off into some really feisty, yet tame little steppers. Tracks like Mark System’s remix of ‘Pathways’ (big shouts to Rider Shafique) and Lurch’s ‘Tangent’ both sought to break away from traditional drum &amp; bass norms, but still added a very pleasant contrast to the mix.</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p>Random Movement and Collette Warren went in on their track “Same Old Feelings,” stirring up emotions in me that I admittedly haven’t felt in some time. It felt all too appropriate to be walking along the boardwalk, watching the setting sun as it fell behind the crashing waves of the Pacific when this song came on. I couldn’t help but stop and stare for a moment, reminiscing on past encounters and taking a moment to bask in nostalgia. Top shelf tune, you two. Excellent work.</p>\n\n<p>The album tops off with an absolute skanker from Ben Soundscape &amp; Superior Selectionz, and then goes down smooth as silk as the dreamy little number “Cenzontle” from Joakuim wraps it all up. It is safe to say that a lot of careful planning went into making this album stand out, and it has most certainly paid off in the end result.</p>\n\n<p>I have found a new favorite for the year so far in this album, and I definitely have to recommend this to anyone looking to indulge in some rich drum &amp; bass vibes as we start heading into spring. Be sure and catch bossman Ben Soundscape and the ever-enchanting Collette Warren touring in Stateside in May.</p>\n\n<p>Words by: Brian Johnsen</p>
667	<div>We caught up with the newly redesigned <a href="http://thensubordinate.com/">Nsub</a> (formerly <a href="https://www.facebook.com/NSUBORDINATE">The Nsubordinate</a>) to see what the new project is all about. From its inception, the team has been committed to documenting the streets and counter-culture from around the world. Now with a new stye and new direction, they will be showcasing this years projects in a print format to display what subculture is all about. Encompassing graffiti, street photography, art, music, festival and underground culture; it will be interesting to see the impact the new magazine has on a new and ever-changing street and underground culture.</div>\n\n<h4> </h4>\n\n<h4>Give us a little history about the magazine and why it was founded. What were the original goals for the project?</h4>\n\n<p>The Insubordinate was established in 2007 as a project that I did in my spare time at SDSU and I wanted to include some of the interest of my friends. It was always intended to be a Zine that documented street culture- mostly graffiti- with some decent color photographs.</p>\n\n<h4>What will you be doing to showcase the new magazine launch?</h4>\n\n<p>The new launch is about us evolving into something different while still retaining the initial integrity of the zine. Over the past year or so we have been collaborating with other companies and groups that we feel represent our lifestyle such as We Ride By Train (train and graffiti lifestyle) and Lost Kawz (drum n bass / festival scene).</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h4>In a fast-paced age with a growing virtual reality, we’re often only a click away from missing some of the most fascinating moments in time. How have you grown and evolved in a changing, digital industry? Why is print media so important?</h4>\n\n<p>We have always had some kind of web presence, whether it was on Myspace or launching our own website, we use multiple social media platforms to promote our work. But at the end of the day social media has no real substance if there’s no physical content that you can put in someone’s hands. I would like to maintain that integrity of print, even if it may not be the main thing we promote.</p>\n\n<h4><img src="http://www.lostkawzlifestyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Issue-4_dojillo-1024x659.png" height="418" alt="Issue 4_dojillo" width="650">Tell us about the Nsub project specifically, and how will it compare to The Nsubordinate. What do you hope to accomplish with this new project?</h4>\n\n<p>The new project is really about rebranding it into something that is more relatable to people who pick it up. The content is still revolving around underground street graffiti culture, but what I would like to accomplish is to connect it with all the other aspects and cultures that is connected with it with such as music and partying. Artists of all types have always congregated together in spaces where there is music and people dancing regardless of the medium that the artists use.</p>\n\n<h4><img src="http://www.lostkawzlifestyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/issue-1-cover-635x1024.jpg" height="484" alt="issue-1-cover" width="300">Many people overlook the correlation between graffiti and underground music and festival culture. Why is it important to bring these things together?</h4>\n\n<p>Back in the 60s and 70s when graffiti was first being established in New York people were getting together on the street or warehouses throwing parties, many times these parties renegades and completely illegal. This was truly the foundation of hip-hop, these gatherings is where all the different art forms such as breakdancing, graffiti, DJ Ing, and MCing got together.  Overtime people moved from hip-hop on the street and into the house music in the club scene; the disco and hip hop scenes really took off in the 70s. House Music grew out of disco in chicago and New York and then San Francisco was during the 80s. Underground culture is really all connected from the street to the clubs to the festivals. It’s really just about people coming together and enjoying art forms.</p>\n\n<h4>Give us a run down on the team and who your contributors are. Any other crews that you regularly collaborate with?</h4>\n\n<p>I am the main editor (deftronism) but the other main founder (mr. Epox) happens to live in Ecuador now.   Some of the other main contributors are Marco “the bastard artist” Bhimani and Mike “mikesumoto” Herana. There have been many contributors in the past all who I consider good friends, but we’re always looking to include new people to grow our base and family.</p>\n\n<h4>Why do you feel it’s important to actively travel and explore?</h4>\n\n<p>One of the most important aspects about showcasing photography in a magazine is that in order to get great content you have to take great trips and meet some great people in the process. Otherwise you’ll be stuck doing the same thing over and over. Traveling keeps the mind fresh and brings innew ideas simply by visiting new places and keeping you young at heart.</p>\n\n<h4>Any travel plans for you or the crew coming up? Previous passport stamps?</h4>\n\n<p>This year were planning on taking more trips cross country to like Chicago and Miami. Definitely expect a trip to Asia Europe and back to the Latin American countries this year.  Probably the best trip that we’ve done is to Mexico City and Ecuador in 2012. That was nuts!</p>\n\n<p><img src="http://www.lostkawzlifestyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/nsub-5_amuse-126-1024x656.png" height="417" alt="nsub 5_amuse 126" width="650"></p>\n\n<h4>What about festivals on the books for 2015?</h4>\n\n<p>We do have some festivals plan such as Symbiosis, Moontribe, and some smaller festivals such as Woogie Weekend.</p>\n\n<h4>Do you have a release date for the next issue?</h4>\n\n<p>The next issue officially drops who are bringing the drum and bass and underground sounds.</p>\n\n<h4>Any last shouts and daps you’d like to give:</h4>\n\n<p>First I’d like to thank everyone who’s ever given me content or asked to be involved in what I do.<br>\nSecond I’d like to thank all the people that of help me produce this project and keep it going. we can keep doing this. we got this. Big ups to the Lost Kawz!</p>

661	<div>We had the pleasure of hanging out with graff writer Mob during our stay at Sun Beats Drum and Bass festival in Ibiza, Spain. His hospitality and local insight made our stay on the island world-class. From quality green, to cutty spots to paint, to advice for good food and bars off the tourist path- this cat hooked it up front to back. He was nice enough to give us an interview and local perspective on graffiti in his hometown.</div>\n\n<p><strong>Alais:</strong> <a href="http://www.lostkawzlifestyle.com/graffiti/www.facebook.com/van.mober">MOB. Mober.</a><br>\n<strong>Age:</strong> 26<br>\n<strong>Country:</strong> Ibiza, Spain<br>\n<strong>Passport stamps:</strong> Amsterdam.Germany.Barcelona.Madrid.Portugal.</p>\n\n<p><cms-plugin title="Image - Mobone2.jpg" alt="Image - Mobone2.jpg " id="729"></cms-plugin><br>\n<strong>How did you get your name and what attracted you to graffiti?</strong><br>\nWell, I got my name around 2002, MOB(er). I used to hang out with my homie Hump, and we started tagging and mobbing around the neighborhood. In 2004 I got into the real meaning of the movement. It became my routine, sketches and more sketching. I wanted to gain fresh letter styles and good flow; it took time. It was a struggle between 2004 -2007 to gain knowledge and meet other dope writers while trying to push my name. When I was a kid I liked to draw a lot, until one day I saw my mom talking on the phone while doing some block letters on the notebook. I thought “Thats fresh… I can do that too”. She was one of my pushers, then skateboarding and hip-hop exposed me to more. Now its graffiti 24/7.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What’s the scene like in your city?</strong><br>\nThe scene in my city is quiet and pretty small, 3 or 4 good locals and a bunch of toy wanna-be’s… but yeah we keep it hot. I’ve created a meeting point for writers, it’s a facebook page called <a href="http://www.lostkawzlifestyle.com/graffiti/www.facebook.com/pages/Graffiti-ibiza/137247763025353">Graffiti Ibiza</a>. You can check all Ibiza graff scene since the early 90’s up to the freshest pieces nowadays. Summer on the island a lot of writers from all over the world, so we have good block parties and jams.

I consider style all facts, tags, throws, and pieces. Nowadays my style is influenced by West Coast graffiti but with European roots. It’s a mix of what I think fresh graff is.</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p><strong>What do you like the most and least about graffiti culture?</strong><br>\nMost- everything! I love all aspects of graff. Least- the beef, getting crossed by toys, and new school hipster street art.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>What would you be doing if you weren’t a graffiti writer?</strong><br>\nI would be a pornstar!</p>\n\n<p><strong>What is your favorite surface to paint?</strong><br>\nMy favorite surface for paint is brick. Love it. With some layers …yea moneyyyyyy!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Any crazy stories run ins with the law?</strong><br>\nHaha A.C.A.B. All day my man. Not going to talk about it.</p>\n\n<p><cms-plugin title="Image - Mobone3-e1387830037525.jpg" alt="Image - Mobone3-e1387830037525.jpg " id="732"></cms-plugin><br>\n<strong>What do you think the future of graffiti is, locally and globally?</strong><br>\nGraffiti its unstoppable. It will stay global with evolving styles and writers connecting.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Favorite food after a long session?</strong></p>\n\n<p>After a good session I go to my brothers place`Pennsylvania Burger’ in San Antonio – best burgers and rolls in the hood- for real. You have to try it.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Smoke or Drink?</strong><br>\nI prefer smoking, true herbalist. But some beers are always cool.</p>\n\n<p><cms-plugin title="Image - Mobone.jpg" alt="Image - Mobone.jpg " id="731"></cms-plugin></p>\n\n<p><strong>Electronic music or hip hop?</strong><br>\nI like both styles of music.

663	<h5>Name: Carlos Rodriguez (CLOS)<br>\nAge: 26<br>\nCountry: Tijuana Mexico</h5>\n\n<p><strong>Tell us about your background, where you are from how you got started  with urban art and street culture?</strong><br>\nI am from Tijuana, MX, but I spent most of my childhood in San Diego. What influenced me the most was skateboarding- which was an everyday routine. Hip Hop music and just all around skateboard culture made me notice all the distinctive graffiti from around the city.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What made you move from graffiti to the studio?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Since I’ve been back in Tijuana the graffiti scene is pretty intense and often pretty dangerous, I began moving away from upfront graffiti in the streets and have spent the last year in the studio, I began to painting on canvas, wood anything I can use as material I can grab. The best part of having a small studio I can be more productive.</p>\n\n<p><cms-plugin title="Image - NYC-e1416075829265-1024x753.jpg" alt="Image - NYC-e1416075829265-1024x753.jpg " id="734"></cms-plugin></p>\n\n<p><strong>Where do you draw most of your inspiration from?</strong><br>\nMost of my work is from random ideas. People I care about, places I would love to visit, and grabbing a few ideas from the master of the modern art work Picasso, Paul Klee, Jean Michel Basquiat, Warhol. Various graffiti artist and Mark Paul Deren aka Madsteez, Bansky, among other insane underground artists.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What is your favorite surface to paint? </strong><br>\nAny Wall is the best place to paint.</p>\n\n<p><cms-plugin title="Image - 10482199_371061466402931_7957971832443671464_n.jpg" alt="Image - 10482199_371061466402931_7957971832443671464_n.jpg " id="738"></cms-plugin></p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p><strong>How has your art influenced taste in music?</strong><br>\nLately I catch myself listing to Reggae, Jazz Blues, and of course Hip Hop, Progressive music Depends on the Art piece I am working on and the color schemes chosen for that particular piece.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How has your style changed from using only aerosol to a more traditional style of painting? Do you still use spray paint?</strong><br>\nMy style still reflects graffiti, but I just mixed in some cubism and started to explore with more abstract work. I still tend to use spray paint on some works, but it’s mainly traditional now.</p>\n\n<p><cms-plugin title="Image - La-Mujer-768x1024.jpg" alt="Image - La-Mujer-768x1024.jpg " id="737"></cms-plugin></p>\n\n<p><strong>What was the appeal of abstract and cubism?</strong><br>\nPicasso is the main focus behind my obsession with this style, and how he was able to create such a big impression with his random ideas. He did this often by taking a very simple idea and transforming it with layers and shapes in to an elaborate masterpiece.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Tell us about your upcoming show and some of the people involved. What will you be showcasing?</strong></p>\n\n<p>This show is just as it sounds: first impressions. Me and my good Buddy Carlos Luelmo will be doing his first show at this great studio Praxiz Art Studio located in Tj Mx on 3rd ave and Revolution.

Its been show after show, I think i’ve done about 7 or 8 shows this year. Hell yea I’m trying to get recognition as much as possible, I am trying to expand globally, haha. I first saw it as a hobby, but as long as I continue to stay focused I’m sure my art will take me somewhere far beyond imagination. It already has.<br>\n<cms-plugin title="Image - life-and-death-768x1024.jpg" alt="Image - life-and-death-768x1024.jpg " id="736"></cms-plugin></p>\n\n<p><strong>Any last shouts?</strong> My Pops for all his support, The Family, OCP, the Homies from DRB, Calafia Puta All the homies from the South Bay Chula Vista, and of course Tijuana instagram me @ clos_tj Big Thanks to  Lost Kawz Lifestyle for this interview.</p>\n\n<p> </p>

1028	<p>Those who walk a different a path from the mainstream are considered the <em>lost causes</em> of society.  The underground movement is looked down on by the masses because we don’t conform to the rules, and we don’t take “no” for an answer.</p>\n\n<p>Lost Kawz Lifestyle unites graffiti writers, DJs, music producers, MCs, junglists and members of the worldwide Drum and Bass community under a common brand. LK has its roots in the concrete jungle of Southern California, and attempts to break from the plastic façade of “popular” culture.</p>\n\n<p>Our designs are unique and push the boundaries of the underground music scene like no other company has before. LK is an escape from mediocre and generic music apparel. We use quality designs from writers and artists who are just as committed to the underground lifestyle as we are. Our designs do more than just make you look good at a party, they represent a lifestyle and a movement that is growing stronger.</p>\n\n<p>Technology is developing fast and artists are progressing like never before both with paint and with sound. It’s time for West Coast drum and bass culture to be united, and LK represents the whole spectrum ­– everything from jump-up to liquid, from raga to tech. We represent DJs and producers who are influential in their local scenes and feature them online for international exposure. Our news feed is updated daily with the latest releases, artist interviews and features, and event reviews.</p>\n\n<p>So this is Lost Kawz Lifestyle’s call to action: for artists, activists, and soundboys of every kind to take a stand against the mass-produced, corporate trash that is taking over our world. It’s time we unite to bring our scene to the forefront, and get the recognition we deserve.</p>

The show featured photographs of urban art and street life in downtown Los Angeles. Graffiti has always been a huge part of LA culture, and the exhibit captured the essence of life on the street from an artistic perspective...</div>

665	<p>This month we caught up with RALER of 8U and THERAP crew from France. From the streets to abandoned buildings, he sheds some light on the scene and on-goings of the Lost Kawz Lifestyle in France. There are many things that set writers apart- such as location, perspective, resources, and tools. However, no matter what the medium, graffiti is universal and RALER consistently strives to remainremains well rounded and active in his home town and pushes the boundaries of graffiti for both himself and his crew mates year around.</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p><strong>Name/ Alias :</strong> RALER<br>\n<strong>Age :</strong> 26 y.o.<br>\n<strong>Country of Origin :</strong> France<br>\n<strong>Countries Visited :</strong> Portugal, Spain, Deutschland, Australia, Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, Greece, Belgium, Austria.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Background. What brought you into graffiti. What age recognize graffiti attempt tags pieces?</strong><br>\nI started to write graffiti out of boredom I guess, there wasn’t much to do in my hometown, and so a friend of a friend, introduced/initiated me to it, from that point I was hooked. I would see tags everywhere I would see stuff in the street that nobody else was. That was in 2006.<br>\n<cms-plugin title="Image - DSCN5269.jpg" alt="Image - DSCN5269.jpg " id="772"></cms-plugin></p>\n\n<p><strong>How long have you been writing. Do you push other styles of art?</strong><br>\nIt’s been almost 9 years now. I don’t push other styles of art but I try to paint on different surfaces that I collect from the different spots I visit, like signs or skateboards for example.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How did your name come to be? What are your crew involvements?</strong></p>\n\n<p>My name represents a well-developed aspect of my personality, but it’s no surprise as I am french so… It means « to complain » or « complainer » (you’d understand if you’d met me).<br>\nI am part of the 8Ucrew and La Therapicturale (or THERAP).</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p><strong>How many People are in your crew and what does it represent?</strong></p>\n\n<p>We’re 6 writers in La Therapicturale (FRAIS, KVIAR, SIMER, GEZIT, CHEIPA, and myself).<br>\nLa Therapicturale is a made up word for Pictorial Therapy, and you can be either the patient and/or the therapist… Personally I am more of a patient.<br>\nI can’t tell for the 8U as I don’t know everyone. There are members all over the globe, but probably around 10 writers or more..<br>\n </p>\n\n<p><cms-plugin title="Image - DSCN54582.jpg" alt="Image - DSCN54582.jpg " id="773"></cms-plugin></p>\n\n<p><strong>Are you only based in Europe?</strong><br>\nYes, we all come from France, mostly Paris suburb. 8U members are spread on different continents around the world.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What do you think is the biggest difference between Euro and American graffiti?</strong><br>\nStyle.! In my opinion that’s the only thing that can make any differences, otherwise Graffiti is the « same » everywhere even though it takes on so many different shapes. Graffiti is too wide, vast, and wild to be compare or even defined; It has something really personal in the process and approach.</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p><strong>How has your style evolved over the years. Do you feel you try and paint more technically or do you tend to go with the flow.?</strong><br>\nI tend to paint more with the flow, because it’s funnier, but to do so you need some technique and I still have a lot to learn, so from time to times I try to paint some technical stuff. But at the end it really depends on the mood.</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p><strong>Favorite paint. and process of painting?</strong><br>\nIt depends what I want to paint, but I’d say MTN94 because you can do pretty much everything with it.<br>\nAbout the process… sketch home, on the wall, fillin’, background, outlines, highlights, and it’s done, classic. Sometimes a little character (or at least some parts of it) but that’s it.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Legal walls or illegal walls?</strong></p>\n\n<p>I don’t paint much on the streets or train or trucks… But the walls I paint aren’t all legal either. I’m more on the exploring side of Graffiti, I like to paint abandoned factories or hidden places, because I like the atmosphere of these places and locations. But I’m not against a little street bombing session with the crew.</p>\n\n<p><cms-plugin title="Image - 20130901_1714083.jpg" alt="Image - 20130901_1714083.jpg " id="774"></cms-plugin></p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p><strong>Do you think its important to remain actively painting illegal graffiti?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Yes I do, because if you only paint legal walls for the city council or dedicated spaces…, well it’s not so much Graffiti anymore. Graffiti is more about gettin’ up, spread your name, find some new spots, explore the city…</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p><strong>How are the laws with graffiti, is there still an active train scene where you are from?</strong></p>\n\n<p>I can’t really tell, because i haven’t been busted yet… But the train scene is really poor, almost non-existing.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Crash chases or painting stories?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Few runs, nothin’ worth to tell, mostly positive stuff, I’ve met many good people so far.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Any last shouts? </strong></p>\n\n<p>Shout to SKERP and all the 8Ucrew. And to KVIAR and FRAIS, two of my therapist !</p>\n\n<p><cms-plugin title="Image - 20150325_165334.jpg" alt="Image - 20150325_165334.jpg " id="775"></cms-plugin></p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p> </p>
